# Computer Networking

As a Devops/SRE engineer, it is important to have a solid understanding of networking concepts because they are fundamental to the design, deployment and operation of reliable and efficient systems. Networking concepts are essential for Devops engineers to understand how data is transmitted across networks, how the devices communicate with each other, and how to troubleshoot and optimize network performance.

Having a good grasp over these concepts gives us idea like how millions of packets gets transported every second through this wide network?, how so many people are using internet with just 2^32 IP Addresses?, how Emails and HTTP Websites get transferred through the network?, how your private chats and messages remain secure throughout the web? and what happens when we hit url in a browser? and so on.

Overall understanding networking concepts is crucial to be able to design,deploy and maintain reliable systems that meet the needs of users.

I have created a list of important Networking concepts after completing Computer Networking tutorial.
